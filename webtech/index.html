            <p>  NFTs are Non Fugible Tokens.They are getting popular day by day as the number of crypto users are increeasing.NFT Tokens
                basically certifictes that are stored in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOVAbKKSH10">Block chain</a>
                NFTs could be anything Digital eg music, movie,  painting or any digital production. Some of the major uses i found for
                nfts are 1. selling nefts could payy the creater pretty good money for the hard work.
                the creator could also opt in for royalty while selling the Token.Creators could be traced back, resulting in Genuinity fo the claims
                .The second thing i find intresting is NFTs could also be a deal breaker in the gaming industry as NFTs could be traced , which means we could easly track asset holders
                , sell assets when we are done with it, it cold also be use for trading like buying o=nfts at low cost and selling it later when the demand is higher.
                Extra:Block chain is a setup that could record data in multiple destinations making the data impossible to hack or cleared. It is basically a ledger that stores every transaction and spreads 
                iyt to ever system in the block chain.

        <p> Virtual reality is a fascinating way to travel using nothing more than the power of technology. With a headset and motion tracking, VR lets you look
             around a virtual space as if you're actually there, or play a game as though you're in it. VR's been gaining traction in recent years thanks to compelling 
             games and experiences, though it still seems very much in a state of flux, with headsets coming and going fairly rapidly. We're tracking the best of what's 
             currently on the market here.Oculus is focusing its efforts on a standalone VR headset, the Quest 2, but providing the option to connect it to a PC. HTC has the tethered Steam-friendly Vive Cosmos and Vive Pro 2. Sony has the PS4-compatible PlayStation VR. Valve has its own expensive Index headset. Even Microsoft is (sort of) supporting its Windows Mixed Reality platform with a scant few third-party headsets. Here's what you need to know about all of them.

          <p>Gamification can be a great way to draw visitors to your booth, collect their contact information and to incentivise their attendance at presentations and demonstrations.
             Including the chance to win a prize will appeal to people’s competitive nature, and by showing a leader board you’ll likely see people engage further, as they will have a 
            reason to come back to your stand to see how they have progressed.It’s important that you ensure your exhibition stand is up to date and
             includes interactive elements. But don’t rely just on eye-catching interactivity – a strong sales team is still a major 
             asset in gathering new customers.</p>

             <p>Customers have grown accustomed to interactive features in their daily lives, as they increasingly depend on 
                 their portable devices. So, when it comes to searching for or buying new products, they expect some level of independence and 
                 freedomYou can display vital information in a simple and versatile manner, making use of eye-catching graphics, images or videos.
                It will also improve your exhibition stand’s efficiency because unlike a direct and personal approach interactive displays can work nonstop, move at the user’s speed and are available at their convenience.
